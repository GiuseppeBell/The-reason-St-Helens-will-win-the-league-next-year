# St-Helens RLFC Past Present and Future
### This year and seasons before

This seasons accomplishments:

- [ ] Challenge cup
- [x] League leaders shield
- [ ] Grand Final Victory

It has been a painful few weeks for us saints fans after being knocked out of the playoffs and not reaching a deserved grand final place.

However... This page will explain the reasons why all is not lost and the how the super league trophy can come home.

We'll start at past victories and defeats where we have reached the grand final:

Grand Final wins | Grand Final losses 
------------ | -------------
1999 | 2007
2000 | 2008
2002 | 2009
2006 | 2010
2014 | 2011

This table shows that we have equally won the grand final just as much as we have lost it. It also shows that during the years 2007-2011 we were very unfortunate or maybe just lacked a good team. The Leeds Rhinos won back to back titles 2007-2010 with Wigan beating us in the 2011 final to add insult to injury. It took us a while to recover but we finally managed to win the final again in 2014 despite being serious underdogs.  

All these past victories were special and each time we won we had special player that was stand out on the pitch. players such as **Jamie Lyon** and **Sean Long** could always turn up to the big games and perform. Sean Long individually won us The Grand Final in 2002!  

This year we had that special player and his name was **Ben Barba**.

[Ben Barba's magic performance](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/article-5723137/Castleford-18-36-St-Helens-Ben-Barba-puts-masterclass-send-Saints-comfortable-victory.html) 

With 25 tries and a man of steel award to his name Benny was outstanding. I even had the privelage of watching him tear Wigan's defence apart on good friday in the 21-18 win. All season long Benny was suberb and all players and fans had the expectations of reaching the grand final. 

Unfortunetly it wasn't meant to be as the Warrington Wolves showed up to Langtree Park and taught us a lesson on how to perform on a semi-final night. Tom Lineham's try crushed the hearts of all saints fans as he crashed over the line with just five minuets left to win the match **13-18**.

### Next years prospects

So saints fans have to wait another year to see if we can make it to the theatre of dreams, however all is not lost as next year is shapng up tobe one of the best...

Yes Ben Barba and Jon Wilkin are leaving, and yes it still hurts, however we can't dwell as their replacements and a few more faces have decided to join us. The new faces include:

1) Lachlan Coote- [Read more here!](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/45679318) 
2) Kevin Naiqama
3) Joseph Paulo
4) Joe Batchelor

With **Lachlan Coote** expected to fill the boots of Barba and a Fijian monster with the name of Naiqama starting at centre it's hard to believe tht saints will be stopped next year. 

Our youth players really started to sparkle this season with some standout performers such as: Danny Richardson, Matty Lees and Jack Ashworth. Danny Richardson's performance in the halves have been quite fantastic considering this is his first full season in the Super League wearing the red V. His goal kicking and lethal step have been noticable and fantastic to watch. The big new props of Matty Lees and Jack Asworth have also been fantastic, their hard work in defence and punishing runs have been outstanding this season and gave the saints a big boost at the end of the season as they came in to replace the tired legs of the seniors. Some other youngesters we can get exited about watching next season also are: Arron smith, James bentley and Matty costello. These three all made appearnces this season but not enough to make a real impact. However next season they may be given even more of a chance to impress and show the saints fans what they can do. 

As an example of how well our youth is doing I will cross out the names of the starting thirteen and bench that played against warrington in the semi final that did not come through our academy:

~~Barba~~, 

Makinson, ~~Morgan~~, Percival, Grace

Richardson, Lomax

~~Wilkin~~, Knowles, ~~Tai~~

Lees, Roby, Thompson

Bench: ~~Peyroux~~, Ashworth, ~~Douglas~~, ~~Louis Mcarthey Scarsbrooke~~.

This shows that over half of the players starting and on the bench are homegrown. This shows great promise for the club. 

With the new signings and the blemishing youths I'm positive that the saints will march all the way to Old Trafford and Wembley to secure all three titles. :trophy: :trophy: :trophy:
