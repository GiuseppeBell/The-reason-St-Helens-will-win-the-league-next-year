# The-reason-St-Helens-will-win-the-league-next-year

This repository will explain the reasons saints will win the league 

It has been a painful few weeks for us saints fans after being knocked out of the playoffs and not reaching a deserved grand final place.

However... This page will explain the reasons why all is not lost and the how the super league trophy can come home.

We'll start at past victories: **1999, 2000, 2002, 2006 & 2014**.
All these victories were special and each time we won we had special players pulling off outragious and courageous skills and plays which meant we had a ighting chance to win. 

However this year we had a very special player named **Ben Barba**. 
With 25 tries and a man of steel award to his name Benny was outstanding. I even had the privelage of watching him tear Wigan's defence apart on good friday in the 21-18 win. I even managed to get a pictre with him. All season long Benny was suberb and all players and fans had the expectations of reaching the grand final. 

Unfortunetly it wasn't meant to be as the Warrington Wolves showed up to Langtree Park and taught us a lesson on how to perform on a semi-final night. Tom Lineham's try crushed the hearts of all saints fans as he crashed over the line with just five minuets left to win the match **13-18**.

So saints fans have to wait another year to see if we can make it to the theatre of dreams, however all is not lost as next year is shapng up tobe one of the best...

Yes Ben Barba and Jon Wilkin are leaving, and yes it still hurts, however we can't dwell as their replacements and a few more faces have decided to join us. The new faces include:

1) Lachlan Coote- [Read more here!](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/45679318) 
2) Kevin Naiqama
3) Joseph Paulo
4) Joe Batchelor

With **Lachlan Coote** expected to fill the boots of Barba and a Fijian monster with the name of Naiqama starting at centre it's hard to believe tht saints will be stopped next year. Our youth players that started to sparkle next year and will grow into real professional players this year will shine I'm sure. Players such as: Matty lees, Jack Ashworth, Danny Richardson and even the Hooker (that had just one game) Arron Smith. 

With the new signings and the blemishing youths I'm positive that the saints will march all the way to Old Trafford and Wembley to secure both titles.
